I built this in what was supposed to be a 30-minute POC that turned into a 10-hour flow state!

XYMake lets you:
‚Ä¢ Access your X threads in clean markdown format
‚Ä¢ Use your content with any LLM, MCP or API
‚Ä¢ Repurpose your X content elsewhere

---

XYMake features smooth onboarding:
‚Ä¢ OAuth2 login (built from scratch using Cloudflare Worker Primitives)
‚Ä¢ Auto-generated OG images for each thread
‚Ä¢ Token counting for LLM context
‚Ä¢ SEO-optimized HTML for crawlers

---

How does it work? Using some neat Cloudflare Worker tricks:

1. The site serves different content to different consumers:
   ‚Ä¢ HTML with og-image to crawlers
   ‚Ä¢ Raw markdown to humans and agents

2. I preload og-image generation with `ctx.waitUntil` for instant social sharing

---

I made this using @workers-og to turn specialized HTML into SVG then PNG, all from a Cloudflare Worker.

The entire project contains ~40,000 tokens of code, built with help from Claude and Grok for code generation from natural language specs.

---

My vision: We should have the right to own and use our own data. X obviously uses our posts to train Grok - we should claim our right to our own conversations too!

I'm only sharing threads where the main contributor has "freed their data" - respecting privacy is important.

---

To try it yourself:

1. Go to any X post you like
2. Change x.com to xymake.com in the URL
3. Get clean, LLM-ready markdown!

Or visit https://xymake.com to unlock your own X data with one click.

What will you build with your freed X data?
