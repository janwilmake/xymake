# TODO

- OG Image for any thread, counting tokens and including usernames and images of the participant(s).
- Respond with HTML but only for crawlers. This HTML is also SEO optimised
- Create MCP named 'Social Data MCP' and add this to the dashboard.

# Wishlist

- Index the totality of posts as well (update this daily)
- Ensure Google indexes it too by adding sitemap
- Show your threads in the dashboard.
- `/janwilmake` should also be accessible for agents and respond with md,json,yaml file object for every thread
- Simple LLM Analysis for all your threads that allows for improved SEO, search, etc.
- Fix DO for data aggregation: Make it easier to debug what happens in the alarms with a special log function, then make the explorer able to easily switch between available DO names (use cf api)
