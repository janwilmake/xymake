# CHANGELOG

## 2025-03-24

- ✅ Initial implementation (see https://x.com/janwilmake/status/1904080559422288062)
- ✅ Calculate data!
- ✅ Respond with HTML but only for crawlers. This HTML is also SEO optimised

# TODO

- OG Image for any thread, counting tokens and including usernames and images of the participant(s).
- Add terms and conditions checkbox on landingpage for clear consent!
- Create MCP named 'Social Data MCP' and add this to the dashboard.

# BACKLOG

- Get the actual URLs of media and links
- Index the totality of posts as well (and update this daily)
- Ensure Google indexes it too by adding sitemap
- Show your threads in the dashboard. To see more than Top 10 most recent, pay $20/month!
- `/janwilmake` should also be accessible for agents and respond with md,json,yaml file object for every thread
- Simple LLM Analysis for all your threads that allows for improved SEO, search, etc.
- Fix DO for data aggregation: Make it easier to debug what happens in the alarms with a special log function, then make the explorer able to easily switch between available DO names (use cf api)
