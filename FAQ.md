# What's the rationale for having people unlock their content?

1. **Cost**. I can't give too much for free. I'm looking to find a way to make people buy something more easily too.

2. **X Terms** - they state you can't redistrubute X content publicly; it's grey area for sure

3. **Respecting Privacy** - I feel like a lot of people are not aware that it's already public, and LLMs are getting smarter by the day, so I think it's just a nice thing to do, being respectful.

4. **Marketing** - I feel this actually gives people MORE incentive to share this tool, at least, that's what I'm aiming for. And it kinda works! Got 31 signups so far.
